Unknowns:

The allocation strategy is a pretty thin scaffolding.
- Could go down a layer and have Journal keep in-memory index invariant info
  that avoids the need to page the entire journal in to confirm/update/truncate
  allocation info.
- Hard to tell about allocation strategy for Betree until we write it.

I want to understand Betree:
  - trunk nodes
    - direct links to Branches,
    - but can duplicate destination: need multiset alloc abstraction

  - indirection
    - want 'em

  - the B+trees
  - lookups!
  - alloction / free strategy

Eventually need to add realistic cache. Presently we pass entire DVs.
Presently imagining this shown as a refinement layer

Lookups, Jay Normal Form, Receipts are all examples of "Eager Skolemization"
