In this refinement layer, we show how a journal and an abstract map data structure
are coordinated to give rise to the spec semantics.

Next steps:
Program should be System -- no disk, we're going to refine a model of the next layer's
IOSystem to the Spec.
The objects should be the interpretation types from the layer below.
Look at the transitions to understand what happens when, in the real system,
we'd CoW or something.
This will sort out who needs to track uiop reqids.
