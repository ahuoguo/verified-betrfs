  apt-get install camlidl

From vendor/fscq/src/README:

  apt-get install libfuse-dev
  apt-get install libextunix-ocaml-dev libzarith-ocaml-dev


Okay, you need coq installed, and ubuntu comes with something old (8.6);
readme asks for >=8.8.
https://coq.inria.fr/opam-using.html
sudo apt install opam
...and Ubuntu opam is 1.2.2 failing "Make sure opam version is 2.0.0 or above".

I followed Installation from sources at
https://github.com/coq/coq/wiki/Installation-of-Coq-on-Linux
sudo apt-get install build-essential
sudo apt-get install ocaml

... which includes a recent opam. Interesting.

opam-depext coq
opam pin add coq 8.11.0
eval $(opam env)
cd fscq/src
time make

make: /opt/ghc/8.0.1/bin/hsc2hs: Command not found

cabal update

Yay! I think I have binaries!
