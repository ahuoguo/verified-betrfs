Specifications
  - Prusti limitations
    - Lack of ints and other math objects
    - Comment-based specs
    - Datatype equality
    - Existentials
  - Mathematically pure constructs
  - Tidy syntax for:
    - state machines
    - Sharded state machines for concurrency? 
  - Dafny constructs
    - Ints, nats
    - Seqs, Maps, Sets, Multisets

Discussion of algebraic datatypes
  - Perhaps an impl datatype with Box simply has box ignored in spec
    - Actually VC can ignore Box
    - Possible challenges with matching on something with Box
   
TODO: Find a Rust parser written in Rust via a generator that we can extend


Logistical items:
  - Oded proposes a full paper on linear Dafny
  - Will the December file system be in linear Dafny or Rusty?
    - Affects which one Jack should be working on
